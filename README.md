## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Logesh, a Software Engineer, self-taught Programmer who specializes in Wireless and IoT domain.
I am passionate about Python, Go, Linux, API.

_Here i have listed some of the projects that I have done._
  - **NetFie**
    - NetFie is a dashboard that monitors some of the Network services. The Network service includes HTTP(S), DNS, NTP... 
      
    - Here is the link to [NetFie Web APP](https://netfie-9d483.web.app/#/).

  - **Finlyser**

    - Finlyser is a mobile APP which is used to Track your expenses.
    - You cound add your expenses in this App and you could also visualize your Expenses over a period of time.
    - Visualize your Total Expenses, Year wise expenses, Month wise expenses on the particular year and Day wise expenses on the particular month.
    - The Main moto for me to develop this APP was user data privacy. The Expense that you add in this app to track is completed resides on your Mobile. (This APP doesn't requires any Internet connectivity since none of the data leaves your Phone.)
    - The User needs to create an account to proceed further but the coolest thing about this app is that User doesn't require to enter their Phone number or email or anything, just Username and Password is good to go. By doing so this app doesn't gets any of the User info.
    
    - The APP isnâ€™t published on the Playstore. I have just build this APP for my personal use so i havenâ€™t taken steps to publish it. Frankly, i have moved to another project to work on so I am not willing to publish this and provide support for this App. (In future, i might make more additional features to this App and then I will try to publish)
    - But if you want to explore my APP, you can find the APK file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-jo1RWmXxlJlCjesdEE_JnMAJIlLgPmI/view?usp=sharing), i have uploaded in my drive.

  - **Delete Directory Recursively**
  
    - This CLI app finds and deletes the given directory recursively in all the hierarchies from the given path.
    - The main moto for me to build this app is to delete the **\_\_pycache\_\_** directory in my Python Project. This **\_\_pycache\_\_** will be created in almost all the directories in the Python project. Based on my project requirement I may have 5 to 7 directory hierarchy levels.
    - So, when I need to rm that dir its hectic for me. So here I have developed this App to do that. Just I can give the dir name as **\_\_pycache\_\_** and the path **my Project root path** to my app then this magic happens.

  - **Delete and/or Display Empty Files Recursively**
  
    - This CLI app finds and deletes the empty files in the given directory recursively in all the hierarchies from the given path.
