## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Logesh, a Software Engineer, self-taught Programmer who specializes in Wireless and IoT domain.
I am passionate about Python, Go, Linux, API.

_Here i have listed some of the projects that I have done._
  - **NetFie**
    - NetFie is a dashboard that monitors some of the Network services. The Network service includes HTTP(S), DNS, NTP... 
      
    - Here is the link to [NetFie Web APP](https://netfie-9d483.web.app/#/).

  - **Expense Tracker**

    - Expense Tracker is an mobile APP which is used to Track your expenses. You can add the expense in that APP with some details for that expense.
      
    - By doing so this APP will keep track of your expense by Year,Month,Day wise. You can navigate through dates to see your expenses.
    - Also it gives the total expense on Year, on Month, on Date.
      
    - The APP isn't published on the Playstore. I have just build this APP for my personal use so i haven't taken steps to publish it. Frankly, i have moved to another project to work on.
      
    - But if you want to explore my APP, you can find the APK file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mE9UHZsR4n6DDLzX47E3ESo1JAvejEGH/view?usp=sharing), i have uploaded in my drive.
      
      
  - **To-Do CLI APP**
 
    - To-Do APP for the CLI users.
    - You can add tasks to your list. Mark the task as done. Remove the task without marking it as done.

  - **Delete Directory Recursively**
  
    - This CLI app finds and deletes the given directory recursively in all the hierarchies from the given path.
    - The main moto for me to build this app is to delete the **\_\_pycache\_\_** directory in my Python Project. This **\_\_pycache\_\_** will be created in almost all the directories in the Python project. Based on my project requirement I may have 5 to 7 directory hierarchy levels.
    - So, when I need to rm that dir its hectic for me. So here I have developed this App to do that. Just I can give the dir name as **\_\_pycache\_\_** and the path **my Project root path** to my app then this magic happens.
